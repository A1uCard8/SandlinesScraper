- Scraped Data Storage: JSON? MongoDB? SQL?
- MongoDB Database: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/673cee9dc464e07dbea515ea#/overview
- APIs Used: Praw, Reddit
- Methods of Analysis: Keywords, Sentiment Analysis
- API vs HTML web scraping? (API access to the website data is far more scalable and adaptable)(My understanding is that HTML web scraping is for one time analysis and not concurrent live scraping)
